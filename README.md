# Singleton Design Pattern in Java

🚀 This repository contains an example implementation of the Singleton design pattern in Java. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

## Code Description

📁 The code demonstrates the Singleton pattern using the `Logger` class. The `Logger` class is responsible for logging messages and is designed to have only one instance throughout the application.

The code consists of the following files:

- `Logger.java`: Defines the `Logger` class and its methods.
- `Main.java`: Contains an example usage of the `Logger` class in the `main` function.

## Usage

✨ To use the `Logger` class, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Peliah/SingletonPattern.git`
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file to see the example usage of the `Logger` class.
4. Customize the logging messages or add additional functionality as needed.

## Dependencies
